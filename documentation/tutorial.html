<h1>Loading native extensions</h1>
<p>
    Native PHP extensions are compiled into *.so files, and can be enabled by adding 
    a line to the core php.ini configuration file - or one of the additional 
    configuration files that are loaded by PHP. If you do not know where you can 
    find the PHP configuration file(s) on your system, you can run the following 
    command from the command line:
</p>
<p>
    <code><pre>
        php --ini
    </pre></code>
</p>
<p>
    Extensions are enabled by adding "extension=name.so" lines to the
    configuration file - where 'name' should of course be replaced by the name of 
    your extension. A default PHP installation already comes with many default 
    extensions, so in the configuration file(s) on your system you will certainly 
    find a number of these "extension=name.so" lines.
</p>
<p>
    The extension lines either take an absolute path ("extension=/path/to/extension.so")
    or a relative path ("extension=extension.so"). If you'd like to use relative
    paths, you must make sure that you've copied your extension *.so file to the
    default extension directory, so that PHP can find it. To find out this default
    extension directory, use the following command line instruction:
</p>
<p>
    <code><pre>
        php -i|grep extension_dir
    </pre></code>
</p>
<p>
    When PHP starts, it loads its configuration file(s) and for each "extension=name.so"
    line in it, it will open the appropriate library, and call the "get_module()"
    function from it. Each extension library must therefore define and implement 
    this "get_module()" C function. The function is called by PHP right after
    the library is loaded (and thus way before pageviews are handled), and it 
    should return a memory address that points to a structure that holds information 
    about all functions, classes, variables and constants that are made available 
    by the extension. 
</p>
<p>
    The structure that the get_module() returns is defined in the header files of 
    the Zend engine, but it is a pretty complicated structure without good documentation. 
    Luckily, the PHP-CPP library makes life easier for you, and offers an Extension 
    class that can be used instead.
</p>
<p>
    <code><pre>
        #include &lt;phpcpp.h&gt;
        
        extern "C" {
            PHPCPP_EXPORT void *get_module() {
                static Php::Extension myExtension("my_extension", "1.0");
                return myExtension.module();
            }
        }
    </pre></code>
</p>
<p>
    In the example above you see a very straightforward implementation of the
    get_module() function. A number of elements require special attention. For a 
    start, the only header file that you see is the phpcpp.h header
    file. If you're using the PHP-CPP library to build your own extensions,
    you do not have to include the complicated, unstructured, and mostly undocumented
    header files of the Zend engine - all you need is the single header file of
    the PHP-CPP library. If you insist, you are of course free to also include the header
    files of the core PHP engine - but you do not have to.
</p>
<p>
    The PHP-CPP library is a C++ library, and you can use all features
    of this language. However, PHP expects your library, and especially your 
    get_module() function, to be implemented in C and not in C++. That's why we've 
    wrapped the get_module() function in an 'extern "C"' block. This will instruct 
    the C++ compiler that the get_module() is a regular C function, and
    no C++ name mangling should be applied to it.
</p>
<p>
    The PHP-CPP library defines a "PHPCPP_EXPORT" macro that should be placed
    in front of the get_module() function. This macro makes sure that the get_module()
    function is publicly exported, and thus callable by PHP. The macro has a different
    implementation based on the compiler and operating system.
</p>
<p>
    Inside the get_module() function the Extension object is instantiated, and the
    Extension::module() method is called. It is crucial that you make a <i>static</i>
    instance of this Extension class, because the object should exist for the entire
    lifetime of the PHP process, and not only for the duration of the get_module()
    call. The constructor takes two arguments: the name of your extension and 
    its version number. The Extension::module() method returns the memory address
    that PHP needs to initialize the library.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the example above does not yet make any native functions or 
    native classes available in PHP - it only creates the extension.
</p>
<h1>Exporting native functions</h1>
<p>
    An extension is of course only useful if you define functions and/or 
    classes that can be accessed from PHP scripts. For functions you can do this 
    by adding your native function implementations to the Extension object:
</p>
<p>
    <code><pre>
        #include &lt;phpcpp.h&gt;
        
        extern void example1();
        extern void example2(Php::Parameters &params);
        extern Php::Value example3();
        extern Php::Value example4(Php::Parameters &params);
        
        extern "C" {
            PHPCPP_EXPORT void *get_module() {
                static Php::Extension myExtension("my_extension", "1.0");
                myExtension.add("native1", example1);
                myExtension.add("native2", example2);
                myExtension.add("native3", example3);
                myExtension.add("native4", example4);
                return myExtension.module();
            }
        }
    </pre></code>
</p>
<p>
    What do we see here? We've added four function declarations ("example1", 
    "example2", "example3" and "example4") to the source code of our extension. 
    The reason why we've only declared the functions, and not fully implemented 
    them is to keep the example code relatively small. We assume that the 
    four example functions are implemented in a different file. In a real world 
    example you could just as well remove the "extern" keyword and implement the 
    four functions in the same source file as the get_module() call.
</p>
<p>
    The four functions all have a different signature: Some return a value, while
    others do not return anything. And some take parameters, while others do not.
    Despite the different signature of the functions, they can all be made
    available in PHP by adding them to the extension object, by simply calling
    the myExtension.add() method. This method takes two parameters: the name by
    which the function should be accessible in PHP, and the actual native
    function.
</p>
<p>
    In the example above we've used different names for the native functions
    ("example1" up to "example4") as for the PHP functions ("native1" to
    "native4"). This is legal - you do not have to use the same names for your
    native functions as for your PHP functions. The following PHP script can be 
    used to call the four native functions:
</p>
<p>
    <code><pre>
        &lt;?php
        native1();
        native2("a","b");
        $x = native3();
        $y = native4(1,2);
        ?&gt;
    </pre></code>
</p>
<p>
    The signature of the four example functions are exactly the signatures that
    are supported by the PHP-CPP libraries. Every native function that returns
    void or a Php::Value object, and that either accepts a Php::Parameters object
    or no parameters at all, can be added to the extension object and can thus
    be exported to PHP.
</p>
<h1>Working with variables</h1>
<p>
    Variables in PHP are non-typed. A variable can thus hold any possible type:
    an integer, string, a floating point number, and even an object or an array.
    C++ on the other hand is a typed language. In C++ an integer variable always 
    has a numeric value, and a string variable always hold a string value.
</p>
<p>
    When you mix native code and PHP code, you will need to convert the non-typed 
    PHP variables into native variables, and the other way round: convert native 
    variables back into non-typed PHP variables. The PHP-CPP library offers the 
    "Value" class that makes this a very simple task.
</p>
